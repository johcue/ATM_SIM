# Simulated Automated Teller Machine in C#

Simulation of an Electronic ATM, in which a balance defined by an administrator is initially available, and withdrawals are allowed for a maximum value of $600,000. The cashier must contain 50% of the denomination bills of $50,000, 30% of $20,000 and the rest of $10,000. As a result of the withdrawal, the user must be shown the number of bills of each denomination that are delivered. Note: the cashier must deliver at least 1 bill of $10,000 and 2 of $20,000, as long as the withdrawal amount exceeds $50,000 (as long as the necessary number of bills is available, otherwise the transaction can be made in bills of any denomination), if the ATM does not have enough money, the user must be informed.
